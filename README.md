# Time_series_Analysis
To conduct a time series study on NHS admissions and GP referrals, data inspection should be done to understand the characteristics of the dataset. This includes checking for missing values, outliers, and any other anomalies. Descriptive statistics, such as mean, median, and standard deviation, can also be calculated to provide a general overview of the data. Correlation analysis can be used to investigate any relationships between the variables.

To make the time series stationary, trend and seasonality must be eliminated. This can be done through decomposition methods such as the Hodrick-Prescott filter or the X13-ARIMA method. Optimal parameters for a SARIMA model can then be found using techniques such as grid search or Bayesian optimization.

Once the SARIMA model has been built, error validation can be used to assess its performance. This includes methods such as residual analysis, root mean square error, and mean absolute error. The model can then be used to forecast admissions and GP referrals over 2021 and 2031.
